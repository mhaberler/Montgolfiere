Perfect! I've created a D3.js version of the VSI scale that replicates all the features from the matplotlib version:

**Features included:**
- **Logarithmic scaling** with linear region from 0 to ±1
- **Major ticks** at 1, 5, 10 (with bold labels on both sides)
- **Medium ticks** at ±0.5 (only in the linear region)
- **Minor ticks** at 0.1 intervals (0 to ±1) + integer positions 2,3,4,6,7,8,9
- **Vertical orientation** with central scale line
- **Up/down arrows** at the top and bottom
- **Clean styling** with black lines on white background
- **Responsive layout** with centered container

The D3.js implementation uses:
- SVG for crisp vector graphics
- Proper tick mark hierarchy (3 different line weights)
- Logarithmic scaling function matching the original
- Symmetrical labeling on both sides
- 400x800px dimensions as requested

The scale accurately represents the logarithmic spacing where values above 1 are compressed, while the 0-1 range maintains linear spacing for precise low-speed readings.
