            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-blue-800">1. Introduction</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
                This Privacy Policy describes how the <span class="font-semibold">Montgolfiere</span> application ("the App") handles your information. Montgolfiere is an open-source application designed with a strong commitment to user privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe in full transparency, and this policy reflects our dedication to ensuring your data is your own.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-green-800">2. No Data Collection Whatsoever</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
                The core principle of Montgolfiere is that it respects your privacy completely.
                <strong class="font-bold">Montgolfiere does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data, sensitive information, usage statistics, or any other form of data from its users.</strong>
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li class="mb-1">
                    There are no analytics tools, advertising trackers, or third-party services integrated that could potentially access your information.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-1">
                    Your activities within the app are confined entirely to your device and are not shared with us or any other entity.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-1">
                    The app does not require an internet connection to function, unless specifically using a feature that inherently requires one (e.g., if you choose to manually export data to a cloud service yourself, which is outside the app's core data handling).
                </li>
                <li>
                    No user accounts are created or required.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-yellow-800">3. Open Source Nature</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Montgolfiere is proudly open source. This means its entire codebase is publicly available for anyone to inspect, audit, and verify.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can review the source code to confirm that no data collection mechanisms are present. This transparency is a fundamental part of our commitment to your privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The source code can typically be found on platforms like GitHub. Please refer to the app's primary distribution channel or documentation for the exact repository link.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-red-800">4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Given that Montgolfiere does not collect any data, significant changes to this policy regarding data handling are highly unlikely.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, should there be any updates or clarifications, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes, though no action is required on your part as long as the app maintains its "no data collection" stance.
